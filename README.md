## An end-to-end deep collaborative learning model based on multiple information for drug-target interactions prediction.

### 1.IntroductionðŸ¦„

In this study, we propose an **end-to-end** deep **collaborative** learning model for DTI prediction, called EDC-DTI, designed to identify new targets for existing drugs by leveraging multiple drug-target-related information types, **including homogeneous and heterogeneous data**, through deep learning techniques.

Our end-to-end model comprises **a feature builder and a classifier**. The feature builder consists of two collaborative feature construction algorithms that extract molecular properties and network topology properties. The classifier is composed of a feature **encoder** and a feature **decoder**, which are designed for feature integration and DTI prediction, respectively. The feature encoder, primarily based on the **improved graph attention network (GAT)**, integrates heterogeneous information into drug features and target features separately. The feature decoder consists of multiple neural networks for making predictions.

We aimed to minimize the runtime while not significantly compromising the model's performance. Therefore, we removed the transformer module from the original model in our final version and optimized the entire network. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the performance of the model has not been degraded.

  python train.py
  ```

### 4.Train in your DatasetsðŸ¦‰

Our model is based on a variety of heterogeneous information, please be prepared to process good drug features, disease features and protein features, and modify the following parameters for the location of the data, if you need to get the preprocessing code from raw chemical information to features, please contact neound986@gmail.com.

```shell
python train.py --drug_feature_path "your drug feature path" \
                           --protein_feature_path "your protein feature path" \
                           --disease_feature_path "your disease feature path" \
                           --set_path "your binary data path"
```

**Attention:** In order for the model to work properly, set the correct feature dimensions.
